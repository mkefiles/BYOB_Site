# BYOB_Site
#BYOB (Bring Your Own Benefits). A website that I created, which brought together different resources I am able to provide to people who do not want to be at a job solely for "benefits".

The living website can be seen by [clicking here.](http://benefits4.us/)

## Notes on Site

This website is entirely *client side* and the design inspiration was taken from Mint Mobile. The major part of this, from the tech-perspective, is the quiz. I hand-coded a brief quiz using JavaScript and it loads a JavaScript *object* to populate the questions and answers. It will use the users responses to determine the proper response and any applicable warnings that should be provided to the user.
