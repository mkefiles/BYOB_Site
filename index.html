                        So this is where it gets really interesting. This option provides you "group-rates" and it requires that you become an <em>employee </em> of 1099Workers. Now, before clicking off, let me reassure you that you are not required to do any "work". There are no employee-expectations over you whatsoever. It is simply a way in which you can get "employee" benefits at group-rates. The only change-up is that you will receive a $0 W-2 at the end of each year oh... and you'll gain access to benefits.

                        Generally speaking, a Minimum Essential Coverage plan is not considered Minimum Creditable Coverage eligible. MCC plans have stricter standards than MEC plans meaning that they often have higher coverage levels and benefit requirements in certain states like Massachusetts.

                        The main differences between HMO and PPO plans are cost, flexibility and provider-selection. A PPO plan is typically more expensive than HMO plans, <b>however</b> PPO plans offer more flexibility (i.e., you can see providers in and out of the network without a referral) whereas HMO plans usually limit out-of-network coverage to emergencies. PPOs also do not typically require selecting a Primary Care Physician (PCP), which allows you to go to the doctor/specialist directly.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you travel frequently (or have a chronic condition), then a PPO may be a better fit. If you most get care in your home city or from a family physician, then an HMO may be a better fit. All plans we offer are Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO plans, meaning that you get a lot of flexibility on one of the nations strongest healthcare networks.

                        Absolutely! Freedom of choice is fundamental to M.C.S. values. There are no network restrictions which means members are free to select their providers based on personal preference, value, cost, and convenience and there are no “out-of-network” penalties. You, ultimately, become a "cash-pay" patient with the medical professionals you work with... worldwide. There are Member Advisors that can help members locate cash-pay friendly medical professionals.

                        Members and Households that experience multiple "Needs" cases within their 12-month Membership Year are required to pay the first three I.U.A.'s at the selected amount. If there is a fourth "Needs" case during the same Membership Year, no I.U.A. would apply. The four "Needs" case, and any subsequent "Needs" case(s), would be eligible for sharing with no I.U.A. subject to any stated restrictions or limitations in the guidelines. Please remember that to qualify as a "Needs" case, the medical expense <b>must</b> first exceed the Member's I.U.A..

                        No prospective member is turned away for having Pre-Existing Medical Conditions, and there is a path to sharing medical expenses associated with a Pre-Existing Medical Condition. The community does have a look-back period of 36 months that applies to all Pre-Existing Medical Conditions for the applicant(s). A Pre-Existing Medical Condition is any medical condition that existed prior to membership (diagnosed, suspected, or producing observable signs or symptoms). Needs that result from Pre-Existing Medical Conditions are subject to sharing limitations unless 36 months immediately prior to the membership effective date has passed without any signs or symptoms of the condition, without any treatment needed, without any medication prescribed or taken, and without any suspicion by the patient or doctors that the condition is resurfacing. This applies whether or not the cause of the symptoms is unknown or misdiagnosed. Pre-Existing Medical Conditions will become eligible for sharing based on the Member's tenure with the community, as indicated by the applicable <a href="https://sedera.com/membership-guidelines" target="_blank">Membership Guidelines</a>.

                        No. Some carriers do have strict requirements around their Hospital Indemnity plan and having <i>minimum essential coverage</i>, however we have a carrier that does <b>not</b> have this mandate. All other plans (i.e., Accident, Critical Illness, Disability, etc.) do not have any requirements.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If anything, having multiple supplemental benefits are a great way to <em>self-insure</em> at a cost that is much cheaper than obtaining health insurance. Not to mention that you could, as an example, obtain a Hospital Indemnity plan with Cash Value / Return of Premium and, at the end of the term, get all of your premiums back tax-free (minus any policy pay-out(s)). Talk about a cool <em>savings</em> account that provides you some reassurance in the event that something goes wrong.

                        It varies, however most of them are around $7 - $10 per week. Disability Insurance and Life Insurance tend to fall under the Supplement Benefit wing and those premiums depend heavily on your income and the amount desired (respectively).

                        Put simply... you get your money back. Having insurance can be good, but knowing you can get your premiums back if you have not used the policy is great. State-pending, most of our plans (i.e., Accident, Hospital Indemnity, Disability, etc.) offer some type of Return of Premium or Cash Value. The only caveat is that a policy with a Return of Premium Rider will tend to cost more on a monthly basis.

                        Unlike the Health Insurance and Medical Cost Sharing options, which can be enrolled in independently, supplement benefits have muliple moving parts. These can be tweaked and customized to fit your need and it is rare that a person will ever enroll in all of them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When we sit down and discuss options, we tend to discourage employees from exceeding 1.5 - 2 hours of their weekly pay. Don't worry... we are <b>not</b> high-pressure sales reps that will over-insure you just to make a buck. We stand behind the idea that insurance is useless if you're just going to drop it let alone the idea that it would have you burning your money. Oh and... quiet part out loud, insurance agents get charge-backs if a policy cancels within the first year.

                <p>
                    Maybe you already have Health Insurance. That's not a problem... you can still get your own Supplemental Benefits such as Accident, Critical Illness, Disability Insurance, etc.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a side-note, a standalone Hospital Indemnity plan is highly recommended if you would like to offset the cost of deductibles and co-pays. The money from these are all paid to you <b>not</b> the hospital or doctor(s).
